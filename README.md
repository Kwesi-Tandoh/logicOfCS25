## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester you will be able to:

1. **Master propositional & predicate logic** ‚Äì formally specify statements and interpret semantics.  
2. **Construct & critique formal proofs** ‚Äì apply natural deduction, direct, contrapositive, and contradiction methods.  
3. **Apply logic to CS problems** ‚Äì perform resolution, SAT solving, and write simple Prolog programs.  
4. **Communicate logical arguments effectively** ‚Äì present and defend positions in class debates.  
5. *(Optional)* **Use automated reasoning tools** ‚Äì encode theorems in Prover9 or an SMT solver such as Z3.
